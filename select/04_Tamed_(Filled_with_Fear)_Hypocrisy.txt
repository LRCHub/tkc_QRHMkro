Everything is built on conspiracy
There's nothing that can been changed
We just smile, accept everything
Why do we turn our backs and walk away?

It's hard to tell right from wrong
It's all a conspiracy
Like blindfolded cattles
They'll lead us until the end

We all are living in a twisted society
Nothing's gonna stop them
When the truth won't set us free

Tamed
Filled with fear
Tamed
